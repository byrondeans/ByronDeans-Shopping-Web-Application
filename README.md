# ByronDeans-Shopping-Web-Application

This web application is written in Python/Flask and uses PostgreSQL.  To install, add the SQL to your database.  Go into application.py and change the database name to whatever you want: the working title of the project was byronslist so you might want to use that, or you can search and replace all the instances of it with your own name.  Then run "flask run" after installing Flask.  I use venv instances for all my Flask applications, and you might want to do the same.
